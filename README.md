restapidoc
===

This is a RESTful API documentation plugin for the [Grails][Grails] web application framework.
Very much inspired by [Swagger][Swagger] API documentation, this plugin reuses the available information of
Grails Domain classes to minimize documentation effort and to improve consistency.
This approach aims to be a deeper and less narrative Grails integration than the original [Swagger][Swagger] JAX-RS idea:
* extending Grails RestController
* using Grails HalRenderer
* uses Annotations just for documentation purpose and not for semantic information
* is as concise as possible
